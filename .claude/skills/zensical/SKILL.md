## Overview

Zensical is a modern static site generator built by the creators of Material for MkDocs. It reads Markdown source files and configuration from `zensical.toml` (or `mkdocs.yml` for compatibility) and produces a fully themed, searchable static HTML site. It is written in Rust and Python, supports live preview, differential builds, and a rich ecosystem of Markdown extensions for technical documentation.
